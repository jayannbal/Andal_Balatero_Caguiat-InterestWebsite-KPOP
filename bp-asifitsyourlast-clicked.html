          <p1>
            As early as mid-May 2017, YG Entertainment officials had confirmed
            that BLACKPINK were working toward a June comeback, and on June 5 it
            was revealed that Black Pink would be filming the music video for
            the new single during that week. On the same day, YG Entertainment's
            CEO Yang Hyun-suk released a photo of Black Pink on the filming
            location of the new music video, confirming that Black Pink would
            make a June comeback, which is 7 months after the group's last
            release Square Two with the songs "Playing With Fire" and "Stay" in
            November 2016. The next day on June 6 it was announced that Black
            Pink would likely release the new song between June 15 and June 20.
            <br />
            <br />
            On June 13, 2017, YG Entertainment revealed a teaser of the new
            single and confirmed the release date to be June 22. Subsequently
            from June 16 to June 18 each of Black Pink's members' individual
            teaser was released. On June 19, the title of the single was
            revealed to be "As If It's Your Last" (Korean: 마지막처럼), and the
            time of the new release was confirmed to be 6 pm KST on June 22.
