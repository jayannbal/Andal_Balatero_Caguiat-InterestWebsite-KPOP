          <h2>Introducing the album</h2>
          <p1>
            The title track, "I Don't Want to Cry," which opens the "age of
            sadness" where a boy meets and overcomes sadness! Their namesake
            2017 "SEVENTEEN" first album [Al1] that opens this year contains the
            new charm of "SEVENTEEN" that exceeds expectations. [Al1] contains
            another step in the boy's growth shown in the album released by
            Seventeen over the past two years. If the songs of "SEVENTEEN,"
            which lead to "Adore U," "Manse," "Pretty U," "Very NICE" and "Boom
            Boom," are about a boy getting to know the feelings of love, "I
            Don't Want to Cry" is a song about the first deep moment of sadness
            he felt in his life. When the moment came when he might lose
            someone, who was like the boy's whole life, he expressed his despair
            and pure heart that he never wanted to lose it with the words "I
            don't want to cry." Maintaining the pure emotions of the boy that
            "SEVENTEEN" has shown so far, but showing a deeper appearance. In
            order to show such deep emotions, "I Don't Want to Cry" also
            attempted EDM for the first time as "SEVENTEEN". As the synthesizer
            containing lyrical sensibility and the violent beat intersect, it
            captures the heart of "SEVENTEEN," who feels like tears will flow,
            but does not want to cry.
